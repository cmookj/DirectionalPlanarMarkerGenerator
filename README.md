# dir_planar_mkr_counter
This project examines the number of possible planar markers in n by n black and white array form, which do not have ambiguity in the determination of the orientation.

Each of the generated markers can be cased in "PGM" file, as well as the whole dictionary.  (See the main.cpp file)

The figure 'figures/dict_3x3.pgm' shows an example 3 by 3 dictionary generated by this program.
